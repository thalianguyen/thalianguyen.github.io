            <h4>(description)</h4>
            <p>Undertale Rewritten is a spin on the tutorial at the beginning of the game <br>
            Undertale, where you first meet a character named Flowey. Instead of proceeding forward <br>
            with the game's story, players instead are met with a game of dodging these "friendliness pellets." <br>
            In this game, the more "friendliness pellets" you dodge, the more points you earn! The use of randomness <br>
            occurs during the fight with Flowey, where a random amount "friendliness pellets" are shot at you in random <br>
            places. The longer you survive, the more "friendliness pellets" are shot at you. There's even an easter egg if <br>
            you pass a certain score!
            </p>
            <h4>(reflection)</h4>
            <p> Both my partner (Lawrence) and I are big fans of the game Undertale. So, we <br>
            wanted to create a game that was playable on Scratch. Though there were some already <br>
            made, we decided to use ideas from both the original game and put some new things in it! <br> 
            Two successful points in the development of our game was how we were able to find these sprites <br>
            online which made this much easier to do. Another point is how we were able to find time to both work <br>
            on these separately in order to add all the elements we wanted into it. Two obstacles that we faced <br>
            while working on this game was the creation of the circle and getting the songs to stop and play at the <br>
            times we wanted it to. The creation of the circle required us mapping out almost 60 points by hand and <br>
            inserting all these points in one by one. The next part included cloning the pellets to these 60 points <br>
            and having them gradually come towards the heart. Songs became an issue as well; often times, we created new <br>
            broadcasts in order for these songs to work properly and stop properly. This also taught us when to use which <br>
            block for a sound to work a certain way. If we had more time to work on this game, we would've created the sprites <br>
            ourselves for a game that's much more unique and showcases our personality.

                 This is one of our most important algorithms that helped with the randomness of the "friendliness pellets." Without this, <br>
                 the game wouldn't get hard past a certain score as well. By cloning this one pellet and having it targeted in random spots, <br>
                 this is what made our game fun since players would have a hard time trying to dodge so many bullets at one time. This algorithm, <br>
                 depending on what you do and where it's launch determines the difficulty and when you lost the game so it knows when to stop the pellets.

                 This is our use of the "more blocks" to create our circle of "friendliness pellets" that surround the player when they lose the <br>
                 game by failing to dodge these "friendliness pellets."  As you can see, there were a lot of points that went into the circle (it <br>
                 still continues past this screenshot!)
